# Server side design
This document describes the data structure of the database, the API and most importantly, the API's intended use within the client applications. It also specifies the way that WebSockets are implemented.
## Data structure
This is the data structure for the MongoDB database. All the `->` are references to an `_id` from the specified document.

### Questions
```
_id: ObjectId
question: String
answer: String
category: String
```

### Team
```
_id: ObjectId
appliedGame: String -> Games
name: String
```

### Games
```
_id: String
closed: Boolean
playedQuestions: [ObjectId -> Questions]
teams: [{
 _id: ObjectId,
 name: String,
 roundPoints: Number
}]
rounds: [{
 answers: [{
  question: ObjectId -> Questions
  closed: Boolean
  answers: [{
   team: String
   answer: String
   approved: Boolean
  }]
 }]
 activeAnswer: Number
}]
activeRound: Number
```

## WebSockets API
### QuizApp
The following WebSocket is expected to be opened after the user applies to the quiz.
```
http://SERVERNAME/ws/PASSWORD/team/TEAMNAME
```

#### Application accepted
Event: `joinGame`

Message: `{ joinGame: true }`

#### Application denied
Event: `joinGame`

Message: `{ joinGame: false }`

#### Next round
Event: `changeRound`

Message: `{ changeRound: true }`

#### Next question
Event: `changeQuestion`

Message: `{ changeQuestion: true }`

#### Question closed
Event: `closeQuestion`

Message: `{ closeQuestion: true }`

#### Round closed
Event: `closeRound`

Message: `{ closeRound: true }`

### QuizMaster
The following WebSocket is expected to be opened after the user opens the game for applications.
```
http://SERVERNAME/ws/PASSWORD/master
```

#### Update applications
Event: `updateApplications`

Message: `{ updateApplications: true }`

#### Update answers
Event: `updateAnswers`

Message: `{ updateAnswers: true }`

### QuizScore
The following WebSocket is expected to be opened after the game has been opened for applications.
```
http://SERVERNAME/ws/PASSWORD/scores
```

#### Update scores
Event: `updateScores`

Messages: `{ updateScores: true }`

## REST API
Note: all `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` APIs will return a message with the following structure, in addition to the response specified in the API's specification.
```
{
 success: Boolean,
 error: String
}
```
